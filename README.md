# Topological-Malware-Propagation-Discrete-time-Simulation-
Simulation of topological malware propagation in a simplified network by using discrete-time simulation technique. Until nowadays we still do not have a good analytical model to model malware spreading in a topological network. Email virus/worm, social-network based virus/worm, smartphone virus/worm based on Bluetooth communication, etc., all of them can be treated as topological malware. 

There are 3 processes –
- -
-
O, when the process is using other resource.
W, when the process is being pushed to waiting queue due to busy status of NIC.
S, when the process is being served by the NIC.
! We have these three cases and each of the 5 processes is given initially with ‘O’ status.
! So, for making 50,000 servings by NIC card we have taken a for loop and iterated it for 50,000 times.
! Each time a process is in ‘O’ status will try to use NIC, if NIC is free it will change the status to false and use it!
! If the NIC is already busy it will be pushed into Q array, this Q array is implementing our priority queue.
! Once an element is pushed into Q, it will come out on priority basis. It will be compared for its index value, which states the priority.
IMPORTANT VARIABLES:
1. EventList[]=Anarrayof5storing5randomvaluesinitially.
2. NIC_STATUS=ItshowsthestatusofNICcard,whetheritisfree
or not.
3. NIC_TIME=anarraystoringeventtimings.
4. NIC_BUSY=CalculatingthetimeforwhichNICisbusy.
5. Q=anarrayusedforimplementingpriorityqueue.
IMPLEMENTING PRIORITY QUEUE:
For implementing priority queue, we have taken a simple array and pushes element into it in each iteration and whenever the NIC is busy and Process has to wait.
Then the Q containing elements is checked for priority conditions and then element with the highest priority is popped out from the Q and sent to NIC.
For simplicity, index values of Q are treated as priority for the actual processes, i.e. process on 5th is checked first and accordingly different indexes are also checked.
OUTPUT:
(1)NIC_BUSY_TIME = 124990/3.749621160758909e+05 (UTILIZATION)
(2)Simulation end time = 3.749621160758909e+05
(3)For showing how many times each process uses NIC service we have an array R that keeps an record of each process. Therefore, value of R is –
[1000,1200,5000,6200,36600]
This value shows that process 5 used the NIC card 36,600 times process 4 used the NIC card for 6200, process 3 uses NIC card for 5000 times, process 2 uses the NIC card for 1200 times and process 1 uses the NIC card for 1000 times.
(4)For waiting time we have taken an array W[] which keeps an record of the processes waiting in queue. Therefore, the value of W is – [4320,332,240,12l,23]
For this much average time each process has to wait up simultaneously.
