# -Topological-Malware-Propagation-Discrete-time-Simulation-
Simulation of topological malware propagation in a simplified network by using discrete-time simulation technique. Until nowadays we still do not have a good analytical model to model malware spreading in a topological network. Email virus/worm, social-network based virus/worm, smartphone virus/worm based on Bluetooth communication, etc., all of them can be treated as topological malware.
